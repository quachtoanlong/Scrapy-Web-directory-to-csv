# Scrapy spider
A web spider to crawl data from a directory to a csv

# What does this do
In a project with the NUS Business School, I created this crawler to help me input data from a directory to a csv file, instead of doing it manually.

The manual tasks were to go to https://bizfaculty.nus.edu.sg/faculty-directory/, copy the name, department, and information of into a csv for later synchronization. It would take a couple of time for each data.

With the spider, the tasks are still the same, but the spider bot will do it within a few seconds.

# Folder directory

1. The spider name is gettheprof. It is stored in the folder gettheprof
2. The crawled website is https://bizfaculty.nus.edu.sg/faculty-directory/
3. Gettheprof.csv is the result of this spider

# Replication
If you are new and wish to replicate the project, here is something you will need:

1. Jupyter notebook (or similar development environment)
2. Basic knowledge about Python
3. Ability to read html/css, and create xpath selector or css selector.
